Introduction:
The NuMicor(TM) M051 Series BSP supports the basic materials for NuMicro M051 series development and provides 
an easy way to use the NuMicro(TM) M051 series. The documents and examples show how to use each peripheral 
library. The pre-created projects of each tool chain (including KEIL and IAR) could be used as an application template.

The supported tool chain includes: KEIL MDK 4.1, IAR EWARM 6.21 or higher versions.

The default debug interface (ICE) of each sample project is Nu-Link. If using U-Link2 or J-Link, you may change the debugger
option of the compiler tool chain.

The NuMicro(TM) M051 Series BSP includes:

\Library
    All device, standard driver and learning board driver libraries.
    The CMSIS files compliant with Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) v3.01 of ARM Corp.
\Document
    NuMicro(TM) M05xxDN_DE Driver Reference Guide and Release Note.
\SampleCode
    All example code for M051 Series.

    v2.02.002
      - To support M05xxDE
      - Modify ACMP name. (ex: Rename ACMPA to ACMP01, ACMPB to ACMP23)
      - Rname Hardware divider prefix name from DIV to HDIV.

2013/06/10:

    v2.02.001
      - Supports new hardware functions of M05xxDN.
      - Modify and add more driver sample codes for M05xxDN.
      - Add ACMP.h
      - Remove 24MHz macro setting for PLLCON.

2012/08/10:

    v2.01.002
      - Fixed the _TIMER_RESET definition.
      - Fixed the SYSCLK_CLKSEL1_PWM23_HCLK definition.
      - Removed the IARv6 directory and supported only IAR v6.21 and higher versions.
      - Modified PLL enable procedure to avoid unstable condition caused by PLL frequency changes.

      - Provided a new driver for faster performance with smaller code size.
      - Created a new directory hierarchy.
    
2012/03/12

    v1.02.003
      - Fixed the UART driver bug.

2011/08/26
    
    v1.02.002
      - Added the NuvotonPlatform_IARv6 directory to support IAR tool v6.10 and later.
      - Supported semihosted input by IAR.

2011/07/08
    
    v1.02.001
      - Updated the header to support 32-bit word access for control registers.

2011/06/20
    
    v1.01.005
      - Fixed the bug about wrong clock source of timer driver.

2011/06/08:

    v1.01.004 
      - Fixed the _PORT_DOUT definition of GPIO header.
      - Fixed the GPIO example in the Driver Reference Guide.

2011/05/31:

    v1.01.003 
     - Added new sample code of learning board in KEIL environment: Smpl_I2C_SW, Smpl_I2C_SW_I, Smpl_Idle.
     - Fixed driver bugs.
     - Updated the clock diagram in the Driver Reference Guide.

2011/01/05:

    v1.01.002 
     - Fixed bugs and added more samples.
